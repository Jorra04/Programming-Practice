THE FOLLOWING IS WRITTEN IN A FORM OF PSEUDO CODE.
THE PROFESSORS INSTRUCTIONS DETAILED THAT THIS COULD BE DONE.
THE STEPS ARE WRITTEN OUT FOR BOTH PART1 OF THE QUESTION 
AND FOR PART2 OF THE QUESTION.
*/

PART1 (WRIITEN IN PSEUDO):
turn clock to port E (port 13)

congifure pin on port E to no pullup and no pulldown, and also set the mux to 1

Configure port E to be output.


PART2 (WRIITEN IN PSEUDO):

-first we must disable the global interrupts.

-after we need to disable port C and port D interrupts  

-configure the clock o port C and Port D by shifting the bits accordingly.

-set the states for both port C and port D. Both as PDDR.

-Next we need to congifure the pull up and pull down resistors along with the mux. This needs to be
done for both port C and port D.

-Next we need to configure the bits, IFQ, etc...

-We then must re-enable the interrupts for both of the given ports, and then once more for the 
the global interrupt.

-use the interrupt to complete a task.
